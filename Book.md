They say to write what you know.

These are the things that I know.

Agencies are a grind house.

Startups can be fickle.

Starting a company is more about losing sleep then it is making money.

Based on all of these things, agencies and startups are where I’ve spent most of my time. I’ve learned about who I am as a designer as much as I’ve learned about being human.

While both of these places have their pros and their cons, there is no mistaking the acceleration that either can provide to your career.

If my objective is to write a book this year then I need to be consistent with the work that needs to be done, and focused at the problem that I’m solving.

Books are solutions.
The are cheat sheets to the world around us.
They are doors into rooms that we’ve not been in yet.

Through the last 10 years of my career, there has to be a solution that I’ve found that others could be searching for.

# Design tools
If you’re readying this book you’ve most likely either taken a look at the tools that are currently used in the field, or you’ve been using your favorite one for a while. Those who have been around for awhile know that once you understand the concepts for one, it’s easy enough to transitions to another tool. The main difference is that each tool is usually really good at a single thing, and pretty good at everything else.

* remove: Modern design tools for the most part accomplish the same goals. A vector based program that allows a UX designer to create pages and flows quickly.

The program of choice is going to be at the discretion of the start up or agency that you’re currently working in.

In the event that you’re the sole designer, there are a few things that you should take into account when choosing a tool.

The main design tools that are used today
Sketch
Figma
Adobe XD
Photoshop

Collaboration features
This type of feature had made it’s way from google docs and into our design tools. While this may not be needed in the short term, these kinds of features are becoming standard in the workplace and you’ll interact with this work style eventually.

* remove: This is great for larger projects and design systems in general.

Cloud storage
The ability to view and edit documents on any device saves both time and headaches.

For those who have had file corruption issue in the past, this is much more secure system.

Historical data
The platforms that have cloud integration usually also have historical data for your individual projects. This means that you have a snapshot of ever version of the file, so you can always download an older copy to regress the design.

There are additional platforms like X that creates “branched” design platform, which is useful for larger scale companies who have multiple teams and projects on the same master design. The branched element allows you to pull a copy of the latest, and work on a specific part of the file. In order to compile your new designs into the master file, you’ll need to merge both files to make sure that there are no conflicts.

While brached design platforms are easier at scale, there requires an additional level of process as each push needs to be vetted with the master file. Depending on the level of intricacy, this could either be a simple task or a very time consuming one.

For smaller scale start ups the historical data should be enough value without

Prototyping capabilities
When it comes to prototyping, this is where each of the design options really start to blah.

Export features



Design system integrations
No matter what size your company is, a designs system is a must if you’re looking to create a constient and concise experience. The ability to pull elements from a predefined library saves time in design, and well as saves time on the development side.

In terms of integration what you’re looking for is the ability to reference elements from one file to another file.
Same something about the element refresh that sketch has for master / design system files.

Plug-ins
These are going to be specific to you and your companies workflow. Sketch

Handoff features
Depending on the workflow with your dev team, you’ll most likely need some sort of inspect features, allowing the developers to view the designs and inspect each element. Some handoff features also allow the developers to copy and paste code directly from design elements.

Handoff procedures

- Don’t neglect your network

It’s easy to eglect your network. I know I did. When I first started, I thought I could do it all alone. That my grit would lead me when I needed to be. I was able to get there, but it was a lot easier and a hell of a lot more enjoyable when I was working with friends.

As designers we have an inherit need to change the work for the better. For our rebrand to be the talk of the forums (in a good way, of course).


These are a lot of incomplete thoughts. I have a bunch of fragmented ideas, but I haven’t focused on the format of the book. What am I trying to convey?

Probably not a biography, but there needs to be more real life stories. Things that people can connect with.

Ideas and stories with lessons to learn. But I think it should be playful as well. Like a less harsh Mike Monteior. Or whatever his name is.

I think that I can work with the base format that I have. I have no idea how long this thing is going to be though.

What about breaking the content up into newletters?
Maybe I could test some concepts. Of course I wouldn’t want to put the whole book out for free.

Or maybe I do?

Why am I doing this?

To prove that I can write.

To help.

If traction, I’ll run a small batch for physical books.

I would love to have my own book.

I’ve tried to do the UX instagram thing before. I feel like I would have an easier time with Twitter. I’ll have to get out of my comforter zone as I use social media as an infinite scroll machine instead of keeping up with friends. But that’s not such a bad thing. I can learn a new skill.

Being a twitter means that I need to have an opinion though. That’s something that I don’t really like being out there. I guess I’ve always been neutral. I don’t like conflict.

Having an opinion isn’t a bad thing. It’s all about how you message it. Friendly banter is fine.

One of those needs a bit more time investment, but I guess I’ll need to do it anyway. No one’s gonna want to read a random UX book.

* Next steps
Continue to build out the main sections of the book. Thinking that it’s easier to build a framework and then break it down by each of the individual elements. I can add stories once I know what specific items I should be focusing on

* Overlap
There may be items that overlap from chapter to chapter. In this event, future items should reference the past once’s, but the future ones shouldnt’ spend too much time on it.



What are the items that I’m going to need?
